# MobCoinsX

mobcoinsx (configurable remake)

Attempt to make this unique plugin configurable which has been hardcoded already. 


What is need to do : 
    - Make multiple yml files such as Data.yml , Config.yml , Message or language.yml 
    - Data.yml will store the amount of coins the players have, config will allow the players to set the amount of coins they get from each individual mob, the chances for them the get a coin, shop can be in here too, messages.yml will have messages for when a coin is added, removed, dont have enough, and prefix
    - shop in config.yml fully configurable in temrs of the name of the item displayed, cost displayed in lore, etc but when they buy it, they just get the normal item like in crazyauctions.
    
    I really appreciate any help, im just not the best with configs and i believe this resource will be very successful on spigot becuase there are none out there (when i searched today)
